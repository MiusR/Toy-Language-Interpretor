# Toy Language Interpretor

**Toy Language Interpretor** is a lightweight interpreter and debugger for a custom toy programming language.  
Designed for learning, experimentation, and exploration of language implementation concepts, this project comes with example programs out of the box so you can start interacting with the language immediately.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project includes:

- An **execution engine** that runs programs written in the language  
- A built-in **debugger** for step-through execution and inspection  
- Ready-to-run **example programs** to help you explore language features

The interpreter serves both as a reference implementation for educational purposes and as a foundation for experimenting with interpreters, compilers, language design, and execution models.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ **Custom Toy Language Syntax**  
  Easy-to-read syntax designed for demonstration and learning.

- 🛠 **Interpreter Engine**  
  Execute language constructs directly without prior compilation.

- 🔍 **Interactive Debugger**  
  Step through code, inspect variables, and understand execution flow.

- 📦 **Included Examples**  
  Ready-to-run sample programs illustrating language capabilities.

- 📘 **Extendable Architecture**  
  Easy to expand with new language features and execution semantics.
